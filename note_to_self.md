# nREPL Bridge Improvements

I've made the following improvements to the `basilisp_mcp_bridge.py` file:

1. Enhanced error handling in `parse_bencode_response`:
   - Added support for parsing error messages (`err` field)
   - Added support for parsing exception information (`root-ex` field)

2. Improved the `send_to_nrepl` function:
   - Added socket timeout handling (30 seconds default)
   - Added maximum read attempts (100) to prevent infinite loops
   - Improved error reporting for different failure scenarios
   - Added proper socket cleanup in a finally block
   - Added specific error handling for connection refused and timeouts

3. Enhanced the `eval_code` function:
   - Added better logging of evaluation results
   - Added error logging for failed evaluations

These improvements should make the nREPL bridge more robust and provide better error feedback.

Next steps to try:
- Restart the bridge service
- Test PyTorch integration in the nREPL
- Consider implementing a proper bencode parser instead of regex-based parsing
